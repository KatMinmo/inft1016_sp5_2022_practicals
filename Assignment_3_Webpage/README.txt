Title: Assignment 3: Webpage submission (About me: Katharine)

The application I have created is intended to help people learn more about me as a person, the website I have made is full of infomation
and facts about me. This allows anyone to access this website and learn more about Katharine Brewin. To create this website I used
GitHub to create a HTML file and a CSS file, the HTML file holds all the HTML and Javascript code that makes the webpage run and 
holds all the infomation. While the CSS file is the style file, this file controls the aesthetics of the webpage. I used these technologies
because when combined they are the most straightforward method to creating your own webpage from stratch. 
During the creation of my personal webpage I encountered a few challanges that I feel held my webpage back. I spent a long time troubleshooting
and trying to work out why my Javascript isnt working. Unfortunatly I was never able to work out why <script> tags didn't work. Next time I have
the opportunity to complete this project or another similar one I would love to properly add the light mode and dark mode toggle, adding the buttons
that allows various pictures to be shown. I would also love to add more pages with more detailed infomation.

How to install the project:
All that is needed for my project to run is for the zip folder to be unzipped, the contents should be kept together in the same folder.
double clicking the HTML file will open the website.
