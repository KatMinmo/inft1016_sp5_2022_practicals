            <h2>Current applications of Lovelace's work</h2>
            <p>Ada Lovelace, the Victorian-era mathematician, and writer was a technological pioneer of her time. While working with Babbage, her most famous achievement is the mathematical programming theory on the Analytic Engine, this work led her to be often recognised as the first computer programmer. </p>
            <h3>Theorised programming and code looping</h3>
            <p>The theory work of Ada Lovelace has been used to mould modern programming; her work provided a strong foundation for further mathematicians to develop working code for computers. In Ada Lovelace’s notes, she proposed a method in which the analytical engine Babbage had theorised could repeat a series of instructions. This concept was used to form the looping process used to run a series of commands and if statements which allows modern computers to operate programs.</p>
            <p>While Lovelace’s was a basic version of what is used today, her concept created the foundation for modern programming code that uses looping to run programs. </p>
            <h3>Lovelace's influence on women in STEM</h3>
            <p>Ada Lovelace’s influence has transcended beyond her technological theories. A current application of Ada Lovelace and her work is used to encourage more women to enter STEM degrees and careers.</p>
            <p>Lovelace’s existence alongside her creation has been a helpful catalyst to help and inspire modern day women to enter STEM opportunities. Lovelace as a symbol is part of the reason women in STEM has been steadily rising over the years, since 2015 the proportion of women enrolled in university STEM education increased by 2 percent. This reached %36 in 2019, which is up from %34 in 2015. </p>
