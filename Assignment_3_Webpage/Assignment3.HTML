            <h2>Katharine's favourite foods</h2>
            <p>I have alot of different favourite foods, picking favourites for anything is something that I struggle with. I can never pinpiont a single item that I like more than any others because it all depends on how I'm feeling in that particular moment. For example, sometimes my most favourite food is sushi. However, when its cold I never want sushi, I will always choose soup when its cold and raining. Context and circumstances have always dictacted my current favuorite when it comes to food. Unlike many people, I really don't like sweet food. There are very very few times I will ever want to eat something sweet. </p>
            <h3>Katharine's hobbies</h3>
            <p>When I am not at University, studying, or working I like to think I have quite a few hobbies. There are lots of things in my life that I really enjoy doing when I have the time. I would consider myself an introvert, this is why activities such  as reading, writing, playing instruments, learning a language, or computer gaming really excite me. Whenever I have free time, the most important thing to me is that I will be relaxed and be able to recover from the study or work I was doing. While I do enjoy being social and going out with friends, spending time alone and enjoying an activitiy by myself is always a perfect way for me to recover</p>
            <p>Reading and writing are my favourite hobbies out of them all, getting lost in a fantasy world of wonder and magic is hands down my favourite thing to do. However, I often have to force myself not to read while University is running because I am the type of person that can and will read for 12 hours straight and forget all of my responsibilities.</p>
